                        Keep it simple at this calm and centrally located place.
                        The place is close to many shopping centers and markets.
                        You get to relax in a clean setting with a detached garden area that will make you feel at home.
                        The house is 400 quare ft. with a full bath, a mini kitchen and a living room.
                        The extra hight ceilings make the house feel more spacious.
                        The sofa converts to a bed. We have a handmade counter area that adds character to the room and a great porch/deck to relax on.

                                <p>
                                    Fantastic place. It's very clean and spacious and there's amazing light coming in from the huge windows.
                                    Fatimah was such a great host, even though we didn't personally meet, and everything went smoothly.
                                    The location is also great and quiet for people who like running or walking.
                                    I would suggest bringing a car or taking into consideration the fact that you might need to call a cab to go into the city from the location.
                                    Overall, I would recommend the place anytime.

                        The location is in one of Istanbul's most prominent districts near the city center.
                        It takes 10-12 minutes to walk to Taksim Square and Istiklal Street, and 4 minutes to go to Nisantasi.
                        It is fairly easy to get to historical sites and museums.
                        There are restaurants, cafes, supermarkets, and shopping centers nearby.
                        The bus and metro stations are two minutes away.

                                    This house is fantastic, and Ali is an excellent host.
                                    He made certain that everything was in order and that we were having a good time during our stay.
                                    The location is ideal, right beside the park.
                                    We would go for daily walks and hang around with the kittens.
                                    I highly suggest this place.
